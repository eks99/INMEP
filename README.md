The Influence of Neuron Models on Error Patterns

We test the hypothesis that the activation function of neurons has an influence on the error pattern of a neural network. We conduct a series of experiments to study this impact with the images classification of Tiny ImageNet with three simplified Alexnet CNNs that use Relu, Swish and Sigmoid activation functions. The repository contains the code of the three models and ordinary and ordered confusion matrices, which we use for the error patterns analysis.
Our experiments results show that the choice of activation function effects the error pattern of a CNN that is used for image classification task.
